            <p>Myr is crowded.
                People everywhere, empires jostling for space. All news from the mainland is of conflict-to-be.</p>
            <p>There are whispers of dark mages on all sides, have the old ways returned?</p>
            <p>Everyone tells themselves that the conflicts haven&#39;t yet reached the frontier, but there&#39;s been a
                constant
                stream of imperial ships to and from Motal since the first eclipse, as soon as the storms died down;
                Salrun has been
                turning away anyone without The Queen&#39;s Mark for almost as long. The Three Heroes have been on the
                mainland
                politicking for a twelveday.</p>
            <p>Every independent hold is feeling the pressure to pick a side, or else.</p>
            <p>There&#39;re whispers of an ancient artifact here on Doro. Could the artifact be why the great powers are
                gathering
                forces? What if you find it first?
                Crystal is stuffed to bursting with bounty hunters, explorers, and self-proclaimed demigods. Everyone
                wants a piece
                of ancient magic.</p>
            <h4 id='common-knowledge'>Common Knowledge</h4>
            <hr />
            <h5>Units of measure:</h5> <br>
            <h5 id='time'>Time</h5>
            <p>A day is 24 hours, with hours of sixty minutes, and minutes of sixty seconds.
                Days are grouped into twelve, called twelvedays.
                Above that, most people will track time by the regular eclipses of the two moons.
                There are two eclipses each summer, one at the start and one at the end, then another in midwinter.</p>
            <h5 id='distance--length'>Distance / Length</h5>
            <p>A godless mix of Metric and Imperial, varying wildly.
                There is no lore reason for this, I&#39;m just lazy.</p>
            <h5 id='currency'>Currency</h5>
            <p>In Imperial and free towns, trade is by barter or grams of gold.
                In the realm of The Queen, trade is by tokens of value increasing by ten.</p>
            <p>When entering the Queen&#39;s Realm, all gold must be exchanged at the current exchange rate (whatever
                that may be)
                for tokens. </p>
            <p>The exchange rate varies, but 1gp is usually worth around 9sp of tokens.</p>
            <p>These tokens are used for all official trade in the Queen&#39;s Realm, any trade carried out with any
                other currency
                will have you immediately arrested by the Registats. </p>

            <h4>Political Powers</h4>
            <hr />
            <h5 id='the-queen'>The Queen</h5>
            <p>The Queen has ruled for over 200 years over a massive empire known as The Queen&#39;s Realm.
                She rules with an iron fist, with the help of her elite police force, the Registats.</p>
            <p>Every Registat stands at least six feet tall and three feet wide of solid muscle. Runes of power adorn
                their faces,
                and their left eye is a glowing, empty socket.</p>
            <p>There are whispers of people who speak against the crown disappearing, only to return days later still
                moving, but
                with no bones and no thought of their own, as if only their skin remains as a balloon of blood.</p>
            <p>The Queen and the Empire of the Golden Crown are constantly jostling for land, but Registats seem weaker
                the further
                they are from The Queen.</p>
            <p>Fantastical stories of the capitol abound. Dubbed &quot;the Palace of the Gods&quot;, The Queen&#39;s
                palace seems to
                grow taller and more magnificent in each description.</p>
            <h5 id='free-holds-of-the-starlit-crown'>Free Holds of the Starlit Crown</h5>
            <p>The only other continental power, the Starlit Crown holds power over the half of the continent that
                isn&#39;t under
                The Queen&#39;s rule. Generally considered a good place to live, though the current ruler Princess Calia
                is not well
                loved.</p>
            <p>The Starlit Crown prides itself in being a peaceful place for everyone, and are working actively to
                explore and
                redocument the world after The Queen&#39;s assault on history.</p>
            <p>There&#39;s talk of a Book of Ages secreted away somewhere in Alia, the easternmost city and the capitol
                of the
                Starlit Crown.</p>
            <h5 id='the-rift'>The Rift</h5>
            <p>The gnomish kingdom of the Rift used to be a great store of knowledge and invention, until The
                Queen&#39;s forces
                swept over it, confiscating or burning all the knowledge they could find. Now, the gnomes of the Rift
                are the best
                farmers in the world, though nobody believes that&#39;s all they&#39;re doing.</p>
            <h5 id='three-towns'>Three Towns</h5>
            <p>The three towns Crystal, Murraywake, and Fury were founded by three heroes soon after they discovered the
                continent
                of Doro. Together, they form the Triumvirate of the Three Towns; this Triumvirate was once the most
                powerful force
                on Doro, but their strength has begun to wane.
                At the center of Crystal stands it&#39;s namesake, a massive crystal with constantly shifting colours.
            </p>
            <h5 id='other-minor-powers'>Other Minor Powers</h5>
            <p>The freedom afforded by Doro&#39;s distance from imperial powers has allowed several small independent
                nations to pop
                up. In no particular order, these nations are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sleethold</li>
                <li>Swangulf</li>
                <li>Wesley</li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Religion</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>The main pantheon contains four gods:
                Serarin (CG, CN, TN), god of nature.
                Sises (LG, LN, TN), god of stone and seas.
                Armin (CE, NE, TN) , god of fire and conflict.
                Ranmar (CG, NG, CN, TN, CE, NE), god of the stars.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Most towns will have a minor patron deity based around a landmark.
                In The Queen&#39;s Realm, all religion other than worshiping The Queen is completely illegal.</p>
