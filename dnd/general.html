        <h5> A note on rules </h5>
        <p>
            The DM has the final say on a whether or not, or how, a rule applies.
            In the event of confusion, the DM's decision will apply for the rest of the session. <br>
            Discussion of meta-mechanics must happen out-of-character, and must not interrupt the session.
        </p>
        <h5> A note on powergaming </h5>
        <p>
            I'm fine with powergaming and min-maxing as long as you adhere to the spirit of D&D, that is, as long as you
            are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>having fun,</li>
            <li>playing your role,</li>
            <li>helping others have fun, or</li>
            <li>helping others play their role.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I'm completely fine with trying to be as powerful as possible, but D&D is not a game you can win, 
            so don't treat it like you can lose either. <br>
            <span class="note" style="display: inline;">Cheating is never OK.</span>
        </p>
        <h5> Dice </h5>
        <p>
            I use the standard die notation, that is <span roll>[number]d[faces]+[modifier]</span>, 
            for example <span roll>4d6+2</span> means to roll 4 six-sided dice, and add 2 to the sum. <br>
            I also use notation for discarding some dice, <span roll>d[number]h</span> and <span roll>d[number]l</span>
            to drop a number of the highest or lowest dice respectively. <br>
            For example, the standard roll for generating stats (<span roll>4d6</span>, only take the three highest rolls)
            would be represented as <span roll>4d6dl</span>. <br>
            <br>
            Where only one die is rolled or dropped, <span roll>1</span> may be omitted.
            For example <span roll>d6</span> instead of <span roll>1d6</span>, 
            or <span roll>4d6dl</span> instead of <span roll>4d6d1l</span>.
        </p>
