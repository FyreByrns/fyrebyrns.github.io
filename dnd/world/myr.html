                A hardy race with a limited claim to immortality. <br>
                Dwarves are immortal unless by outside influence. <br>
                When in regular contact with the light of either moon, Dwarves are mortal. <br>
                Dwarves have no grasp on the arcane, and are completely incapable of casting magic themselves.
                Dwarves can, however, etch power into runes. While every dwarf can etch limited power into basic
                runes,
                great power and complex runes require years of experience. <br>
                <hr>
                Dwarves stand 3'6" to 5' tall. <br>
                Dwarves are stocky, often nearly as wide as they are tall, solid with muscle. <br>
                Their arms are often nearly as thick as their thighs.
                Some grow rotund with age, though just as strong.
                <br> <br>
                Dwarves wear their black or red hair in thick braids. <br>
                Dwarves sport any natural colour of skin.

                A secretive race with limited claim to immortality. <br>
                Elves are immortal unless by outside influence. <br>
                Elves have long passed from the memory of other races, only living on in myth and legend. <br>
                When an elf does appear in civilization, most react with fear and distrust. <br>
                <hr>
                Elves are tall and willowy, and generally dislike frivolous matters. <br>
                Elves never sleep, and will age twice as fast as humans until their mid twenties,
                at which point they will barely age at all for centuries.
                <br> <br>
                Elves have fair hair, ranging from bright white with a green tint to dirty blonde.
                Very rarely, an elf will have striking red hair.
                <br>
                Elves sport any natural colour of skin.

                A friendly race with an affinity for craft. <br>
                Gnomes are quick to trust and slow to anger, but will never forget a slight. <br>
                Gnomes are said to be born from Doran, and under the moonlight they are refreshed and strengthened.
                <br>
                You can often find Gnomes on a clear night lying out in a field, or frolicking about the meadows. <br>
                <hr>
                Gnomes are short and slight, standing on average a good foot shorter than Dwarves.
                <br> <br>
                All Gnomes have some tone of brown hair. <br>
                Gnomes sport any natural colour of skin.

                <hr>
                The look of a Living Stone will tell a story about their existance. <br>
                A Stone which came to a gentle existance will have defined corners, perhaps delicate filigree adorning every inch of their body. <br>
                One which has lived through harsh conditions will be eroded smooth. <br>
                Whenever a Living Stone is thinking, countless runes sparkle like the stars all over their bodies. <br>
